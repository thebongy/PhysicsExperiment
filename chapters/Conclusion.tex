We conclude that Hess's law is a useful tool for indirectly measuring enthalpy changes for reactions, if the enthalpy changes are hard to directly measure. Another useful thing found from this experiment was that the reaction between NaOH and HCl can be used to easily determine the heat capacity of a calorimeter system.
