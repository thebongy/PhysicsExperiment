The results of this experiment clearly show that the as the ampltiude of a pendulum increases, so does the error of approximation of assuming it to follow an SHM motion. We alo conclude that using a more accurate proof through calculus considering the forces in the system, we can produce a more accurate equation for the motion of a pendulum, which satisfies all angles of release in the domain. We also conclude that by measuring the range of a pendulum projectile, we can accurately predict the angle where it had been cut.
