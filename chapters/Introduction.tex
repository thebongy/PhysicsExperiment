The standard enthalpy of formation is an important quantity used by chemists, and also in the manufacturing industry. Often, it is very difficult to directly measure the enthalpy change in certain reactions. Hess's law is used in these cases to indirectly measure the enthalpy change of the required reaction by carrying out another series of reactions, and using the data gained by those reactions to compute the net enthalpy for the required reaction.

Magnesium Oxide is an important mineral that is used majorly for the manufacture of \emph{Portland Cement}. Therefore, it is important to determine its properties, for it to be efficiently manufactured in industry conditions. Our objective in this experiment, is to measure one of the thermodynamic properties of MgO, its \emph{standard enthalpy of formation}.
