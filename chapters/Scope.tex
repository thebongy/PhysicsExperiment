A more comprehensive analysis with this experimental procedure can probably be used to determine the limit at which the errors of Small Angle Approximation in a pendulum become too high to accurately model a system. Using a mounted camera in front of the system and motion capturing techniques, we can actually observe the angle of release when the pendulum was cut and verify the same with our calculated readings in this experiment.
